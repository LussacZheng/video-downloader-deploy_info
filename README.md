In order to display the version information of [**video-downloader-deploy**](https://github.com/LussacZheng/video-downloader-deploy) in the form of svg icon, as above, `package.json` or `manifest.json` is needed. But **video-downloader-deploy**, a batchfile project, does not need these configuration files. To avoid adding unnecessary files, a `package.json` file with the version information will be updated in this repository instead.
